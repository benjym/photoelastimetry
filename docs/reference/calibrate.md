Calibration workflows for `brazilian_disk` and `coupon_test` experiments.

This module provides:

- Calibration profile loading/validation
- Dark/blank scalar correction estimation
- Robust fitting of per-channel stress-optic coefficients (`C`)
- Fitting of incoming Stokes state (`S_i_hat`)
- End-to-end calibration execution and report/profile output
