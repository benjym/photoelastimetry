# Developer Notes

This file is intentionally slim.

Use canonical developer docs under `docs/developer/`:

- `docs/developer/setup.md`
- `docs/developer/testing.md`
- `docs/developer/architecture.md`
- `docs/developer/module-map.md`
- `docs/developer/contributing.md`
- `docs/developer/release-and-docs.md`
